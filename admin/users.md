### Permissions
###### Course Settings
There are four permissions options for each course:

__Enroll Permissions__
Determines who can enroll in the course:

* "Authorized User" - Only logged in users can join the course.
* "No One" - No one can join the course.

NOTE: If you wish to manually add students to your course, choose the
"No One" option, and add users in the Course Admin View.

__Content Permissions__
Determine who can view the content (description and labs) in a course.
Note that only logged in users can start a lab.

* "Anyone" - Anyone can view the course content.
* "Authorized User" - Only logged in users can view the course content.
* "No One" - Course is locked and visible only to instructors and administrators.

!> The last two options may only be changed by an administrator:

__Meta Permissions__
Determines whether a course is included in the explore and search features.

__Featured__
Whether the course is included in the "featured" section at the top of the
dashboard.

###### User Roles
There are five distinct user roles:

__Guest__
Users who aren't authenticated.

__Student__
Users who have been added as a student to a course, or have begun a lab in
a course with "Anyone" enroll permissions.

__Instructor__

cannot add or change labs within the course.

__Course Admin__
Course administrators have the ability to edit a course; adding, changing or
removing labs.  However, they cannot add or delete courses.

__Global Admin__
Global administrators have the ability to create, edit and delete courses, as well as promote
users to course administrators and instructors.
